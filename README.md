# Graphics course on C++ #

The course of computer graphics, where custom engine was built on C++ with QtCreator and some basics functions of OpenGL lib. It can display a scene with 3D objects, allows to fly around the objects and play animations (key-frames used). Also custom shaders, materials, textures, meshes could be added here.

I've tried to build my own engine with shadows and key-frame animations using object oriented paradigm.
I succeded, but the architecture of the engine has some weak places, so **DO NOT USE IT FOR PRODUCTION**. It has only academic purposes to understand the principle how graphic engines work.
